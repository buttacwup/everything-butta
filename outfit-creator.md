The Outfit Creator was released on May 9 2024 as a new premium offering in [CTS Wardrobe](cts-wardrobe.md). "An outfit is a collection of Wardrobe items that lets you define the entire appearance of your avatar, organized in multiple layers." This new feature also comes with a new [stripme](stripme.md) option that will allow others in [[Second Life]] to remove (or re-add) clothing based on the layers defined in the outfit which was created.

### enabling outfit creator

This is a premium feature and requires additional payment above the core of Wardrobe. You can access the Outfit Creator panel by clicking on **Tools** then **Create New Outfit**.

### building a new outfit

The Outfit Creator allows you to build an outfit using different layers. These layers are worn when you put on an outfit. The order of the layers can be used by you or others through the CTS Wardrobe web interface to dress or undress the avatar layer by layer. It can also be used with the new stripme tool to allow anyone to do the same simply by clicking your avatar.

The way the system is currently built you add all of the items you want with the outfit to the default layer (usually the top most layer) and then in each subsequent lower layer you remove the items that you want to be removed.

In the example below I have 4 pieces of an outfit. A top, shorts, shoes and a skin. I have these divided into three layers. 

**Layer 1** is fully dressed. This should be made up of all of the items from Wardrobe that you want to wear as part of the outfit. 

**Layer 2** is No Top. In this layer I add all of the items from layer one minus the top I want to have removed.

**Layer 3** is Not Bottoms. In this layer I add all of the items from layer 2 minus the shorts I want to have removed.

The names you use for each layer are customizable. You can choose anything that makes sense to you and matches the outfits use case.
